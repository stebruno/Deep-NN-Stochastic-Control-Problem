# Deep-NN-Stochastic-Control-Problem
Implemeted in Tensorflow a deep neural network approximation for a stochastic control problem associated to a (tidal) energy storage problem. This was a research project in collaboration with the Institute for Mathematical Innovation and Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Bath.
